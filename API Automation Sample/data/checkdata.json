            "title": "Why React Native For Mobile App Development Projects In 2021?",
            "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For many years now, we have a truly great alternative to native app development. Yes, it is none other than cross-platform development. However, while React Native can achieve the advantages such as reduced cost and time through maximum reusability of code, it ensures delivering a truly native experience. No wonder, in 2021, to create a mobile app React Native is still a viable choice.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>What is React Native?</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&nbsp;</span></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">React Native is a JavaScript-based open-source library that can develop mobile apps across multiple OS platforms and web apps. With a component-based architecture, robust community support, and advanced features such as hot reloading, it helps developers build highly native-looking and native feeling mobile apps at a quicker pace.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRecently Published Article: <a class=\"keychainify-checked\" href=\"https://www.visboo.com/the-future-of-on-demand-mobile-applications/\">The Future Of On-Demand Mobile Applications</a></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Here are the key reasons for React Native to be chosen as the mobile app development framework in 2021.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>Reduced Development Time&nbsp;</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">React Native can reuse code across multiple mobile platforms, and this allows with a few changes transferring an iOS app to Android, requiring much less effort and time. In addition, just by using one code on multiple platforms, React Native reduces the development time and coding efforts to a great extent.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As measured by experts, React Native consumes around 30% less development time than building iOS or Android apps separately for native platforms. This reduced development time ensures lowering down the app development cost to a great extent. Moreover, in many countries, cross-platform app projects mostly rely on React Native. For example, if you </span><a class=\"keychainify-checked\" href=\"https://www.indianappdevelopers.com/react-native-app-development-company-india.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">hire React Native developers in India</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, the front-runner companies are likely to be cross-platform development companies.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>Cross-Platform Advantage</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At first, React Native offers a great advantage in terms of cross-platform presence. However, first introduced for the only iOS, Facebook soon equipped it for android development.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thanks to React Native, developers get complete freedom from using native-specific languages such as JAVA, Kotlin, Swift, Objective C, etc. Instead, the developer only needs to be versed with Javascript and should be able to develop a native UI library, APIs, and hybrid apps.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To make the app look more native, developers also can embed the native platform-specific code instead of struggling to build two separate app versions for iOS and Android.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>Highly Native User Experience</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">React Native can bridge the difference between the so-called native look and feel of an app and the hybrid app. By providing an array of native components that can be reused, developers can easily implement native features in a cross-platform app and ensure a highly native look and feel.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>Live and Hot Reloading</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">React Native offers a hot reloading feature ensuring them to make code changes in actual time and fixing errors while the app is still loading or in use. In addition, react offers a live reloading feature that automatically reloads the whole app as soon as the changes are made. The hot reloading feature helps reload a particular area of an app. This ensures easier, faster, and smooth app development and testing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>Community-Driven Framework</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">React Native is a completely community-driven framework, and a developer community continuously nourishes it spread all over the globe. As a result, all the value additions and enhancements and their documentation are open and accessible to everyone.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Facebook from day one emphasized the developer community&rsquo;s engagement in shaping and improving React Native for app projects. This open-hearted approach towards community engagement ensures increased collaboration, expertise sharing, and reusability of code.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>Robust Third-Party Plugins&nbsp;</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">React Native is continuously getting better, and naturally, components required by specific business purposes need to be addressed by third-party plugins. React Native offers both JavaScript-based and native plugins. Any feature you need to access can easily be made available through third-party plugins.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>A Multitude of Reusable Components</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">React Native as a cross-platform framework boasts of a big repository of reusable components to help faster and smooth development and to help to incorporate app functions easily. Thanks to this component-based architecture of React Native, app development becomes easier.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>Smooth User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI)</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">By using React Native it becomes easier to build fully functional apps that are flawlessly compatible across all platforms and devices. Moreover, it ensures adjustment to the configuration of the device screen with ease while helping with quick and smooth data display. On top of that, React Native, with a lightweight and low footprint built, can easily support high-quality app contents and visual elements.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Read more: </span><a class=\"keychainify-checked\" href=\"https://www.visboo.com/what-process-to-follow-to-build-a-mobile-app-in-2021/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What Process to Follow to Build A Mobile App In 2021?</span></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>Lower Learning Curve&nbsp;</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">React Native is based on JavaScript, a highly popular coding language used for web and mobile apps. This ensures a shallow learning curve. Comprising a wide variety of reusable components ranging from maps to filters, the framework offers a great opportunity to make new developers build their skills.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>Easy Testing and Debugging</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One of the key advantages of React Native is easy testing and debugging. A typical React Native app needs no compilation or re-compilation for evaluating each small change in the code. Thanks to the hot reload and live to reload feature, developers can only introduce these changes in real-time. This helps quicker iteration cycles for React Native app projects.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>Fast App Updates and Maintenance</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Updating and maintaining native apps involves no hassle just because React Native ensures streamlined updating by assigning each platform a unique code. In addition, react Native ensures updating the apps simultaneously on every platform.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">App updates are easily incorporated into any React Native app through live updates streamed over the air. There is no need for manual effort or seeking permissions.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Conclusion</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thus, React Native appears as the most comprehensive solution for modern mobile app projects. Moreover, with so many promises and such a smooth development process offered by the framework; it is likely to remain as viable as ever for mobile app projects.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You can hire IndianAppDevelopers to get feature-rich and robust mobile applications.

            "title": "Top Reasons for Choosing iOS App Development Services for Business Applications",
            "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">iPhone and Android are ruling the app development market and constantly competing with each other. This competition has provided end users with many new and fascinating apps. However, due to their more practical features and superb performance, iOS devices are very popular amongst users. Despite the fact that iOS app development is time-consuming, complex, and costly, business owners envision iOS applications as a lucrative asset for uplifting their business. <a href=\"https://www.indianappdevelopers.com/iphone-app-development-company.html\">iPhone app developers</a> need to work on a mind-blowing app idea, and create a user-friendly, spiced up, attractive, feature rich, and visually stunning iPhone app has the right functionality that can be delivered at the right time. Here are the major reasons why businesses prefer using iOS for business app development.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>A Strong Market of Apple Devices</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since the earliest days of app development, Apple devices have been ruling the smartphone market. Even people using other devices dream of using Apple devices. Thus, the opportunity for developing and marketing your application increases manifold due to the worldwide market of iOS. With the technology advancements in Apple devices and newer advanced versions of iOS, the business sector has something new to discuss each time, especially related to user experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Comprehensive Compatibility</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">iOS is a development platform that is regularly updated and is thus compatible with all existing, new, and upcoming technology innovations. The introduction of new APIs enhanced UI, and frameworks drive iOS developers towards iPhone app development as they gain the needed credits both for themselves and the business for which they develop the app.<br />\r\n<br />\r\niOS apps are mostly compliant with the Apple&rsquo;s devices available in the market, and so the developers can stay focused on creating the app rather than thinking much about compatibility issues. The higher processor speed and advanced features of Apple&rsquo;s devices combined with their large storage space allows the creation of feature-rich applications by iOS application developers that can be developed using the Human interface guidelines. Also, highly scalable mobile apps are needed by businesses now as technology is changing at a much rapid pace than ever before. The iOS platform offers smart and interactive development options to engage and grow users. Hence, businesses look for premier iOS app development services.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Technology and Hardware Support</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The applications developed for the business purpose must exceed client expectations and boost the brand awareness exponentially. iOS makes technologies needed for implementing native apps readily available to developers and also manages the hardware of the device. For example, iOS devices support good audio features which make the music sound extremely good on them. You can also play the audio and record with the standard USB devices. All these facilities can be used by developers to add enhanced features in your app with sound effects and keep the customers engaged.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Superior Quality Apps</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Though Android may be providing a large number of applications, for the quality of applications, one can trust iOS with closed eyes. Apple has set high standards for the acceptance of an app in the App Store. Thus, developers cannot get away without giving their best and generate the best quality applications. This ensures high-quality features and functionality of your business application when developed for iOS platform, differentiating it from that of other competitors. One major reason for the success of iOS platform is its incredible focus on user experience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs the iOS apps can be customized during development, businesses can reach clients directly, thereby enhancing their experience with the app. The superior quality of iOS apps is the reason for the higher in-app sales and revenue generation by iOS apps as compared to Android apps, though the number of downloads of Android apps is much higher. The quality information and customization provided by iOS apps allows them to deliver the right services to the right clients. This boosts the value of the brand among the target audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>High Level of Security</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Security is a priority concern for iOS applications as users and developers are highly affected by it, especially in ecommerce. The rapid increase in the number of in-app purchases increases the need for making the apps secure. It is not possible to install or update any app without the consent of the user in case of iOS constructs as the security level is very high. iOS being a user-centric operating system applies measures against the loss of data security and encryption. In iOS, data handling systems are integrated, and measures are also implemented against duplication of data.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Feature Rich Platform to Serve All Needs</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The integrated development environment (IDE) of Apple provides you will all functions like Syntax Aware, Graphical Interface Contractor, and Compiler Aware, which you can use to build your iOS app. By using Xcode, you can easily move your app on different devices such as from the phone to the tablet. This is not that easy in case of other platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Wrapping up</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With the rapid advances technology is making, businesses need to opt for a platform to build their app that is dynamic enough to meet the ever-changing development needs of the apps. As iOS provides a platform that is having a strong market, comprehensive compatibility, hardware, quality and customization options, along with high security and rich features, it is the best choice for developing business applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">IndianAppDevelopers offers full cycle of mobile app design, app development and app maintain services, as a leading <strong><a href=\"https://www.indianappdevelopers.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"mobile app development company in India\"><strong>mobile app development company in India</strong></a></strong> with our offices in USA that is known to develop outstanding iPhone, Android and eCommerce mobile applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

You can also outsource to gain variety and creativity of talent from online marketplaces such as Fiverr and Upwork.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"md-block-header-two\"><strong class=\"md-inline-bold\">#6: Testing and release</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"md-block-unstyled\">Before its final release, the game app needs to be tested for performance and bugs. You can either do it yourself or outsource it to an app-testing company. After testing check if all guidelines given by Apple are complied with and your app must be harmless, clean, original, and has all iOS-specific features.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"md-block-unstyled\"><strong class=\"md-inline-bold\">Conclusion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"md-block-unstyled\">The process of iOS game app development depends on how you conceive, strategize, and build it.
