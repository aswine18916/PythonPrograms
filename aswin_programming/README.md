# Task

Implement a simple utility to look for patterns in text files, as follows:

1.	Print each line of a hardcoded file (start with 80days.txt).
2.	Print the line number and lines of a hardcoded file (start with 80days.txt). Pattern should be "<line_no>: <line>". 
3.	Search for occurrences of a fixed string in a hardcoded file and print the line number and lines for those lines that match the string.
    If there is no match, print the filename followed by "no match". 
4.	Search for occurrences of a string specified on the command line in a hardcoded file. Print the line number and the line where it occurs.
5.	Search for occurrences of a string specified on the command line in a file specified on the command line. 
6.	Handle errors: what errors could occur? 
7.	Introduce a command line flag to make the search case insensitive. 
8.	Do a word count.
9.	Allow searching for patterns, not just fixed strings.
